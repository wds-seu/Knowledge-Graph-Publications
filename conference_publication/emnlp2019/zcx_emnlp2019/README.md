- **abstract**: In natural language processing, it is common that many entities contain other entities inside them. Most existing works on named entity recognition (NER) only deal with ﬂat entities but ignore nested ones. We propose a boundary-aware neural model for nested NER which leverages entity boundaries to predict entity categorical labels. Our model can locate entities precisely by detecting boundaries using sequence labeling models. Based on the detected boundaries,our model utilizes the boundary-relevant regions to predict entity categorical labels, which can decrease computation cost and relieve error propagation problem in layered sequence labeling model. We introduce multitask learning to capture the dependencies of entity boundaries and their categorical labels, which helps to improve the performance of identifying entities. We conduct our experiments on nested NER datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our model out performs other state-of-the-art methods.
