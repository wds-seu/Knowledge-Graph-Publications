**abstract**:Joint representation learning of words and entities benefits many NLP tasks, but has not been well explored in cross-lingual settings. In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint representation learning of cross-lingual words and entities. It captures mutually complementary knowledge, and enables cross-lingual inferences among knowledge bases and texts. Our method does not require parallel corpora, and automatically generates comparable data via distant supervision using multi-lingual knowledge bases. We utilize two types of regularizers to align cross lingual words and entities, and design knowledge attention and crosslingual attention to further reduce noises. We conducted a series of experiments on three
tasks: word translation, entity relatedness, and cross-lingual entity linking. The results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrate the significance of our method.
