**abstract**:We present a large scale collection of diverse natural language inference (NLI) datasets that
help provide insight into how well a sentence representation captures distinct types of reasoning. The collection results from recasting 13 existing datasets from 7 semantic phenomena into a common NLI structure, resulting in over half a million labeled context-hypothesis pairs in total. We refer to our collection as the DNC: Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection. The DNC is available online at
http://www.decomp.net, and will grow over time as additional resources are recast and added from novel sources.
