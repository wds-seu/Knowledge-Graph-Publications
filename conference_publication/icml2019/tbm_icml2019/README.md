# Predicate Exchange: Inference with Declarative Knowledge
- **author**: Zenna Tavares  Javier Burroni  Edgar Minasyan  Armando Solar Lezama  Rajesh Ranganath
- **abstract**:  Programming languages allow us to express complex predicates, but existing inference methods are unable to condition probabilistic models on most of them. To support a broader class of predicates, we develop an inference procedure called predicate exchange, which softens predicates. A
  soft predicate quantifies the extent to which values of model variables are consistent with its hard counterpart. We substitute the likelihood term in the Bayesian posterior with a soft predicate, and develop a variant of replica exchange MCMC to draw posterior samples. We implement predicate
  exchange as a language agnostic tool which performs a nonstandard execution of a probabilistic
  program. We demonstrate the approach on sequence models of health and inverse rendering.
